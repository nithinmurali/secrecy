Secrecy is where you can safely put your files without worrying that others will see it... They just can't.

I am starting this project since I have tried a number of Apps for secure file storage, while not finding one that best suits my expectations:
- some, like Vaulty and Hide it pro, do not store videos securely and just stores the raw file
- most only support storing pictures and videos. I occasionally want to store word documents but can't find a way.
- some produced by major software companies are simply bloated and litters temp files everywhere... That's just as insecure as not using them.

I am aiming to produce an all-rounded one that maximizes security but still ensuring ease of use and quick encryption time.
